1st Python Challenge

Max and I worked on the for loop together for the PyBank assignment. Then I got the max and min commands from https://datagy.io/python-get-dictionary-key-with-max-value/. Max and I also collaberated on the .index fuction in the following rows. The monthincrease1 can from this website https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48894060/how-to-print-specific-key-value-from-a-dictionary
Then I just printed out the results with the help of https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/len-lenb-functions-29236f94-cedc-429d-affd-b5e33d2c67cb#:~:text=LEN%20returns%20the%20number%20of,be%20available%20in%20all%20languages. Then i just figured out the rest from trial and error



On the PyPoll assignment I got the .keys() formula from this website https://note.nkmk.me/en/python-dict-keys-values-items/
Then for the percentage I just messed around with the dictionary and the keys until it printed something then just kept messing around with it until it worked. The round function I used I recalled from memory from a shorter course I took before this one started. Then for all of the print statements I used the pybank print outs as examples of how it should be structed. Then I used https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48894060/how-to-print-specific-key-value-from-a-dictionary for help with it.
We also got a little bit of help from Max's friend Sam Sliefert. He mostly helped us get started with the csv files and helped us consepulized what the for loop for the Pybank assigment was supposed to be and function.
